# Discontinued, as of latest most recent versions of library is much better to directly integrate google closure library with your app, without frameworky part. I may provide examples how to do this successfully upon request.

#play-soy-view

An implementation of Google Closure library support for Play framework for Java

At the moment, this plugin assumes it will be wired via dependency injection, there is no support for including the plugin in plugins file in play that would result in auto wiring.
Individual components have to be wired via a dependency injection framework of choice or alternatively manually wired.

# Example:

# TODO
- get rid of commons-io dependency

- consider splitting away core and web module since a lot of people may choose to use grunt or sbt -> soy to js compilation instead of ajax controller to compile soy to js

- upgrade to latest soy templates 04.2014 release (pending: https://github.com/google/closure-templates/issues/4)

- Adopt latest google closure templates features

- cross compile 2.3 version for Scala: 2.11.x

- When Play 2.4 is released think about improving library from point of view - dependency injection

- support soy files in app/views, there is an example go to do this based on Freemarker and play integration

- Try more than first accepted languages, if first one fails then proceed to next

- port ContentNegotiator from spring-soy-view

- port excluded properties for reflection to soy converter

- JavaDoc

- Unit Test
